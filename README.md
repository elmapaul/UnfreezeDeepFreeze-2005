# UnfreezeDeepFreeze-2005

# The purpose of this program is to reset a Deep Freeze program(version of year 2005) with new predefined password. 

It was great Challenge with big Win. With practical reverse engineering I have achieved to recover a pass a hence change the state("hacked") of popular then "Deep Freeze".

My real use case that I had at I.E.K. Technical school: 
-> PC Locked physically (passed easy)
-> Award BIOS with password protection (I used BIOS recovery tools for specific version)
-> Locked Windows for Administrator (Windows pass recovery tool while resetting a computer) 
-> Deep freeze in active mode that was MAIN challenge (Running Windows from boot CD and after execute a current compiled program in the Deep freeze's system folder) 

Files:
+ Source code in C++
+ System file where stores the hidden password

P.S. All these actions were made ONLY for research purposes.
